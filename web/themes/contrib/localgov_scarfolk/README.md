title: LocalGov Scarfolk
---

This is an example subtheme which uses localgov_base as its base theme. It's used in production on the [LocalGov Drupal demo site](https://demo.localgovdrupal.org) website.

It's aim is to give an example of how easy it is to create subthemes in LocalGov Drupal when you use `localgov_base` as your base theme. You could use this theme as your base either, but be aware that if we make any decisions in the future to change the design of this theme, that might also affect your custom theme.
