# LocalGov Drupal Workflows

Default editorial workflow for LocalGov Drupal content.

Provides a Drupal content moderation workflow, a content approvals dashboard, content scheduling and content preview.

The content workflow consists of draft, review, published and archived states with permissions for the editor, author and contributor roles defined in localgov_roles (a submodule of localgov_core).

Content scheduling uses the Drupal [Scheduled Transitions](https://www.drupal.org/project/scheduled_transitions) module.
