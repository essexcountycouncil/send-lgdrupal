Your application will be assessed by a Blue Badge eligibility assessor. They may contact you by telephone, or invite you for a face to face assessment to discuss your application further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Appeals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your Blue Badge application is unsuccessful, you can&nbsp;appeal the decision.</p>\r\n"
