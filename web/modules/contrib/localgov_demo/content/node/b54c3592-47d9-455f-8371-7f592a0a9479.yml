You'll then have 2 options:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>we&nbsp;manage your budget and choose the people who provide your care</li>\r\n\t<li>you manage your budget and choose the people who provide your care (this is called&nbsp;direct payment)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you own your home, you may also have the option to make&nbsp;deferred payments. This means that instead of selling your home to pay for care, you can continue to live in it. Payments will be taken from the value of the house after it's sold.</p>\r\n"
