# LocalGov Drupal Open Referral

[Open Referral](https://openreferraluk.org/) is an agreed standard for sharing content about community services. This module provides the required endpoints and administration to configure content to be displayed in the standard.

To create Open Referral output you will at least need to map some content to 'Organisations' and 'Services'. [LocalGov Directories](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_directories) has submodules to automatically configure this for you. You can also add other directory entry types. @todo Link to documentation.
