# LocalGov Drupal homepage paragraphs
Paragraph bundles used in the LocalGov Drupal homepage.  These can be used outside of the LocalGov homepage of course.

## Paragraph bundles
- Homepage IA block: This comprises a link and its child links.
- Homepage Icon: This has an icon and a related link text.
- Newsroom teaser: News title, image, and summary.

## Current status
Work in progress.  The Paragraph bundles are created.  But no front-end styling is provided yet.
