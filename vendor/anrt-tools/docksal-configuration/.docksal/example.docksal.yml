# Docker and Docker Compose based environment for Drupal.
# See https://github.com/docksal/docksal for more information and documentation.

# This is a shared configuration file that is intended to be stored in the project repo.
# For local overrides:
# - create .docksal/docksal-local.yml file (using example.docksal-local.yml) and put local docker-compose configuration overrides there
# - ensure .docksal/docksal-local.yml in .gitignore

# Docksal stitches several docker-compose configuration files together.
# Run "fin config" to see which files are involved and the resulting configuration.
